# Kinect_leapmotion_Processing
There are our interactive design final project. We used Kinect V2, Leap Motion and Processing.

Step 1 ：Depth Capture
We use Kinect to get the depth image and use the Processing Open Kinect library to get a certain depth range of pixels.
Need library : Open Kinect for processing.

Step 2 ：Visualization
By using Processing to control particles or color with depth images.
Need library : Open Kinect for processing.

Step 3 ：Leap Motion
Through using Leap motion to capture fingers position and use this information to control elements, such as movement or color.
Need library : Leap Motion for processing.

Step 4：Real Time Effect
First, using Kinect and Processing in order to get depth image. Then, use Syphon library to transmit video to a VJ software Rseolume Arena in real time. Finally, use Rseolume Arena to achieve real-time effect with music to complete this interactive project.
Need library: Open Kinect for processing; Syphon
